# CCTV-based Helmet & Number Plate Identification

## Project Overview

The CCTV-based Helmet & Number Plate Identification project aims to enhance safety measures by utilizing existing CCTV camera feeds to detect whether a person is wearing a helmet and to read the vehicle's number plate. This system is designed to leverage the power of computer vision technologies, including YOLOv8 for helmet detection and EasyOCR for number plate recognition.

## Features

- **Helmet Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time detection of individuals wearing or not wearing helmets within the camera's field of view.
- **Number Plate Recognition:** Employs EasyOCR to accurately read and extract vehicle number plates from the captured footage.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides relevant information to take appropriate actions based on helmet compliance and number plate data.
- **Frontend Interface:** Includes a user-friendly frontend interface for easy visualization and interaction with the detected information.
